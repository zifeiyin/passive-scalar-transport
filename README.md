Yin, Zifei, and Paul A. Durbin. 
"Passive Scalar Transport Modeling for Hybrid RANS/LES Simulation." 
Flow, Turbulence and Combustion 98.1 (2017): 177-194.


Implementation with dynamic Smagorinsky LES model and the adaptive-DES model.

Lagrangian Averaging of model constant Cs and CDES is used.

Pr_T is also averaged using Lagrangian method.
